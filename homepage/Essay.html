        <h4>
          This is my essay on "The Bell Jar" By Sylvia Plath:
        </h4>

        <div class="mt-3 container">
        <p> The book The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath is about Esther, a college age woman who struggles with her identity and mental health. The book starts with Esther in New York for a scholarship program and follows her declining mental health as she returns home after the pivotal trip. The story details her experiences with multiple doctors and a treatment called electroshock therapy. Throughout the book, Esther’s relationship with eElectricity symbolizes the control that she has and her evolving condition.</p>
        <p> In the beginning of the book, as Esther is losing control, she becomes obsessed with the Rosenbergs, which signifies the declining state of her mental health and foreshadows her experience. By introducing the setting of the first line of the book as “the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs”, it is clear the hold that the execution had on her (1). She was so surrounded by news of the Rosenbergs “staring up at [her] on every street corner” and “over the radio and at the office” that she “couldn’t get them out of her mind” because of the awful way they were executed (1). Esther did not enjoy the scholarship trip in New York like the rest of the girls who were relieved that the Rosenbergs were to be executed. Her differences from the other girls made her feel alone and isolated; she questioned her worthiness of receiving the award, and she felt as though she was not in control of her life which contributed to her declining mental health. Her focus on the electrocution hints at her declining mental state since she was so occupied by an event so depressing. She removed herself from the event by saying that it “had nothing to do with [her]” and despite the “idea of being electrocuted [making her] sick”, she still thought about what it would feel like “being burned alive all along your nerves”, imagining herself in the seat of execution, which foreshadows her experience with electroshock therapy later on in the book (1). Despite the omission of her opinion about the Rosenbergs and the reason for their execution, she sympathizes with them because of the way they were to be executed. During this part of the book, Esther still had some control because she was not the one being electrocuted and it was something she had to imagine. However, her constant thought about the Rosenbergs and the way they were to die by the use of electricity represents the beginning of her loss of control.</p>
        <p>Esther has a complete loss of control when electric shock becomes something she no longer has to imagine. After her first experience with electroshock therapy with Dr. Gordon, who she despised, her mental health continued to decline. During the therapy, Esther described “something” that “bent down and took hold of [her] and shook [her] like the end of the world” (143). The experience reminded her of being shocked by the lamp that used to be her fathers, where “something leapt out of the lamp in a blue flash and shook [her] until [her] teeth rattled”(144). In both experiences, Esther was out of control, strapped into Dr. Gordon’s chair and being shocked by her father’s lamp, her father being someone who she subconsciously blamed for controlling her loss of happiness with his death. In addition, Doctor Gordon himself represented something Esther was jealous of, which was having the traditional “perfect” family, one that may have represented her own if her father had not passed away. Because he seemed to have everything Esther would have wanted, she felt he would never be able to understand her or help her, and she lost trust for him because of this, but was still under his control as his patient. After the treatment, Esther still connected the use of electricity to the punishment of the Rosenbergs because of how traumatic it was for her. After the treatment she “wondered what terrible thing it was that [she] had done” (143). This time, instead of being an indication of her mental health, the electrotherapy was the cause of her further declining mental health. The therapy was intended to help Esther, and when it felt like punishment, she attempted multiple different methods of suicide afterward, perhaps because she thought she was out of options and there was nothing that could make her feel better again. Being the one at the end of the electric shock became a reality for Esther when she had no control.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the nature of Esther’s relationship to electricity dramatically changes as she gains control back after her second experience with electroshock therapy with Dr. Nolan, her female doctor who she trusts. The electricity in this part of the book symbolizes the improvement in her mental health and was what caused her to feel better. As she was waiting to start the treatment, Esther described “darkness” wiping her out “like chalk on a blackboard,” and after, she recalled being woken from a “deep, drenched sleep” (215). She wasn’t fighting for control this time like she was the first treatment. This time, the therapy went as it was supposed to and Esther felt “the bell jar hung, suspended,” over her head, welcoming her to the “circulating air” (215). The electroshock treatment gave her control by lifting the bell jar. The bell jar hanging above her signifies her mental health improving because she wasn’t trapped inside anymore, she felt relaxed and could breathe the air around her and she was finally in control again. The main reason Esther was able to go through with the therapy was because of Dr. Nolan’s support for her. When she was panicking about getting the therapy, Doctor Nolan “hugged [her] like a mother,” and promised to be there the whole time so everything would go the right way (212). By reassuring Esther and being clear about her treatments Dr. Nolan built trust with Esther. Dr. Gordon, on the other hand, only talked to Esther’s mother about treatments and left Esther not knowing what the procedure would be like the day of. The environment that Dr. Nolan created for Esther to have the treatment gave her back some of the control she had lost throughout the story and helped improve her mental health. Her relationship to electricity turned from punishment into something positive that could even help her mental health with the help of Dr. Nolan.</p>
        <p>As Electricity goes from a concept to Esther’s reality, her control decreases and mental health spirals. When she found a way to stop fighting for control, her relationship to electricity changed into something positive and ended up helping her. The environment that surrounded Esther when electricity drew nearer determined her ability to find comfort in her vulnerability and eventually get better.</p>
